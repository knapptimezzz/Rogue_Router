# Rogue_Router

This is a fork of the original rogue router which you can pull from Spark Fun. This repo hasn't seen some love in a while so I wanted to fork it and update it just for fun. Plus maybe add a bunch of other rogue like things to the lists. Look forward to updates. - knapptimezzz

## Firmware Versions

### SDAPServer

...is a sloppy amalgam of SDWebServer and WiFiAccessPoint, orginially from Hristo Gochkov.


### SDAPServerCaptive

...is a sloppy amalgam of SDWebServer and WiFiAccessPoint with some DNSServer thrown in to add Captive Portal functionality. 

Captive Portal modifications are dependant on latest DNSServer library via:
